# EnderOre-MinecraftMod
My first mod for Minecraft forge 1.18.2 that adds minings and craftings for Ender Pearls
![Mod Logo](/src/main/resources/enderore_logo.png?raw=true "Mod Logo")

In Minecraft Vanilla the only way to get ender pearls is to kill many enderman, a rare and powerful enemy with too few chances of give you a reward;
the situation is getting worse with other famous mod that require ender pearls in their craftings.

This mod adds Ender Ore Blocks in all of 3 Minecraft dimensions, which drops the Ender Shard, that combine in a 2x2 crafting gives you an Ender Pearl.
